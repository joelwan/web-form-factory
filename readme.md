# Web Form Factory

You've spent hours designing and implementing your form in PhotoShop, Illustrator, ImageReady, FreeHand, FireWorks, DreamWeaver (etc.) and it's shiny and looks gorgeous.

But unless you send it to a developer or learn to code, it will remain useless forever.
Don't worry. WFF is here. 

Web Form Factory is an open source web form generator which automatically generates the necessary backend code to tie your form to a database. By generating the backend code for you, WFF saves you time... time you could spend doing more interesting stuff.
